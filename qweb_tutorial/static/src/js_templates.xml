<!-- for JS: QWEB temapltes can be created using templates as the 
    root element,
    - like qweb python template this file is not added into data but
    under assets property
    - this template is not added into database and can be loaded only when
    require using `t-call-assets` directive 
        <t t-call-assets="web.assets_frontend" t-js="false" > 
    - we can find assets by inspecting -> Network -> JS, in this we can serach our module
    as well as the template that we have created
    - this template can then interpret JS expression or any `prop` added by
    owl component or widgets
-->


<templates xml:space="preserve">
    <t t-name="qweb_turorials.someJSTemplate">
        <div class="alert alert-primary">
            <h3>This is the main template</h3>
        </div>
    </t>
</templates>
